## Wind Turbine

A wind turbine always supplies electricity when there is wind. There is no wind in the game, but the mod simulates this by turning the wind turbines only in the morning (5:00 - 9:00) and in the evening (17:00 - 21:00). A wind turbine only supplies electricity if it is set up in a suitable location.

The TA wind power plants are pure offshore plants, which means that they have to be built in the sea. This means that wind turbines can only be build in a sea (occean) biome and that there must be sufficient water and a clear view around the mast.

To find a suitable spot, click on the water with the wrench (TechAge Info Tool). A chat message will show you whether this position is suitable for the mast of the wind turbine.

The current must be led from the rotor block down through the mast. First pull the power line up and then "plaster" the power cable with TA4 pillar blocks. A work platform can be built below. The plan on the right shows the structure in the upper part.

The wind turbine delivers 70 ku, but only 8 hours a day (see above).

[ta4_windturbine|plan]


### TA4 Wind Turbine

The wind turbine block (rotor) is the heart of the wind turbine. This block must be placed on top of the mast. Ideally at Y = 15, then you just stay within a map / forceload block.
When you start the turbine, all conditions for the operation of the wind turbine are checked. If all conditions are met, the rotor blades (wings) appear automatically. Otherwise you will get an error message.

[ta4_windturbine|image]


### TA4 Wind Turbine Nacelle

This block must be placed on the black end of the wind turbine block.

[ta4_nacelle|image]


### TA4 Wind Turbine Signal Lamp

This flashing light is only for decorative purposes and can be placed on top of the wind turbine block.

[ta4_blinklamp|image]


### TA4 Pillar

This builds the mast for the wind turbine. However, these blocks are not set by hand but must be set with the help of a trowel, so that the power line to the mast tip is replaced with these blocks (see under TA power cable).

[ta4_pillar|image]


## Solar System

The solar system only produces electricity when the sun is shining. In the game this is every game day from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm.
The same power is always available during this time. After 6:00 p.m., the solar modules switch off completely.

The biome temperature is decisive for the performance of the solar modules. The hotter the temperature, the higher the yield.
The biome temperature can be determined with the Techage Info Tool (wrench). It typically fluctuates between 0 and 100:

- full power is available at 100
- at 50, half the power is available
- at 0 there is no service available

It is therefore advisable to look for hot steppes and deserts for the solar system.
The overhead lines are available for the transport of electricity.
However, hydrogen can also be produced, which can be transported and converted back into electricity at the destination.

The smallest unit in a solar system is two solar modules and one carrier module. The carrier module must be placed first, the two solar modules to the left and right next to it (not above!).

The plan on the right shows 3 units, each with two solar modules and one carrier module, connected to the inverter via red cables.

Solar modules supply DC voltage, which cannot be fed directly into the power grid. Therefore, the solar units must first be connected to the inverter via the red cable. This consists of two blocks, one for the red cable to the solar modules (DC) and one for the gray power cable to the power grid (AC).

The map area where the solar system is located must be fully loaded. This also applies to the direct position above the solar module, because the light intensity is regularly measured there. It is therefore advisable to first set a forceload block and then to place the modules within this area.

[ta4_solarplant|plan]


### TA4 Solar Module

The solar module must be placed on the carrier module. Two solar modules are always required.
In a pair, the solar modules perform up to 3 ku, depending on the temperature.
With the solar modules, care must be taken that they have full daylight and are not shaded by blocks or trees. This can be tested with the Info Tool (wrench).

[ta4_solarmodule|image]


### TA4 Solar Carrier Module

The carrier module is available in two heights (1m and 2m). Both are functionally identical.
The carrier modules can be placed directly next to one another and thus connected to form a row of modules. The connection to the inverter or to other module series must be made with the red low-voltage cables or the low-voltage junction boxes.

[ta4_solarcarrier|image]


### TA4 Solar Inverter

The inverter converts the solar power (DC) into alternating current (AC) so that it can be fed into the power grid.
An inverter can feed a maximum of 100 ku of electricity, which corresponds to 33 solar modules or more.

[ta4_solar_inverter|image]


### TA4 Low Power Cable

The low voltage cable is used to connect rows of solar modules to the inverter. The cable must not be used for other purposes.

The maximum cable length is 200 m.

[ta4_powercable|image]


### TA4 Low Voltage Junction Box

The junction box must be placed on the floor. It has only 4 connections (in the 4 directions).

[ta4_powerbox|image]


### TA4 Street Lamp Solar Cell

As the name suggests, the street lamp solar cell is used to power a street lamp. A solar cell can supply two lamps (1 ku). The solar cell stores the sun's energy during the day and delivers the electricity to the lamp at night. That means the lamp only glows in the dark.

This solar cell cannot be combined with the other solar modules.

[ta4_minicell|image]



## Thermal Energy Storage

The thermal energy storage replaces the battery block from TA3.

The thermal energy store consists of a concrete shell (concrete blocks) filled with gravel. Five sizes of the storage are possible:

- Cover with 5x5x5 concrete blocks, filled with 27 gravel, storage capacity: 22.5 kud
- Cover with 7x7x7 concrete blocks, filled with 125 gravel, storage capacity: 104 kud
- Cover with 9x9x9 concrete blocks, filled with 343 gravel, storage capacity: 286 kud
- Cover with 11x11x11 concrete blocks, filled with 729 gravel, storage capacity: 610 kud
- Cover with 13x13x13 concrete blocks, filled with 1331 gravel, storage capacity: 1112 kud

A window made of an obsidian glass block may be in the concrete shell. This must be placed fairly in the middle of the wall. Through this window you can see whether the storage is loaded more than 80%. In the plan on the right you can see the structure of TA4 heat exchanger consisting of 3 blocks, the TA4 turbine and the TA4 generator. Pay attention to the alignment of the heat exchanger (the arrow at block 1 must point to the turbine).

Contrary to the plan on the right, the connections on the storage block must be on the same level (arranged horizontally, i.e. not below and above). The pipe inlets (TA4 Pipe Inlet) must be exactly in the middle of the wall and face each other. The yellow TA4 pipes are used as steam pipes. The TA3 steam pipes cannot be used here.
Both the generator and the heat exchanger have a power connection and must be connected to the power grid.

In principle, the heat storage system works exactly the same as the batteries, only with much more storage capacity.

In order for the heat storage system to work, all blocks (also the concrete shell and gravel) must be loaded using a forceload block.

[ta4_storagesystem|plan]


### TA4 Heat Exchanger

The heat exchanger consists of 3 parts that must be placed on top of each other, with the arrow of the first block pointing towards the turbine. The pipes must be built with the yellow TA4 pipes.
The heat exchanger must be connected to the power grid. The energy storage device is recharged via the heat exchanger, provided that sufficient electricity is available.

[ta4_heatexchanger|image]


### TA4 Turbine

The turbine is part of the energy storage. It must be placed next to the generator and connected to the heat exchanger via TA4 tubes as shown in the plan.

[ta4_turbine|image]


### TA4 Generator

The generator is used to generate electricity. Therefore, the generator must also be connected to the power grid.
The generator is part of the energy storage. It is used to generate electricity and thus releases the energy from the energy storage unit. Therefore, the generator must also be connected to the power grid.

Important: Both, heat exchanger and generator must be connected to the same power grid!

[ta4_generator|image]


### TA4 Pipe Inlet

One pipe inlet block each must be installed on both sides of the storage block. The blocks must face each other exactly.

The pipe inlet blocks **cannot** be used as normal wall openings, use the TA3 pipe wall entry blocks instead.

[ta4_pipeinlet|image]


### TA4 Pipe

With TA4, the yellow pipes are used for the transmission of gas and liquids.
The maximum cable length is 100 m.

[ta4_pipe|image]



## Power Distribution

With the help of power cables and junction boxes, power networks of up to 1000 blocks/nodes can be set up. However, it should be noted that distribution boxes must also be counted. This means that up to 500 generators/storage systems/machines/lamps can be connected to a power grid.

With the help of an isolating transformer and electricity meter, networks can be connected to form even larger structures.

[ta4_transformer|image]

### TA4 Isolation Transformer

With the help of an isolating transformer, two power grids can be connected to form a larger network. The isolation transformer can transmit electricity in both directions.

The isolation transformer can transmit up to 300 ku. The maximum value is adjustable via the wrench menu.

[ta4_transformer|image]

### TA4 Electric Meter

With the help of an electricity meter, two electricity networks can be connected to form a larger network. The electricity meter only transmits electricity in one direction (note arrow). The amount of electrical energy passed through (in kud) is measured and displayed. This value can also be queried by a Lua controller using the `consumption` command. The current current can be queried via the command `current`.

The electricity meter can pass up to 200 ku. The maximum value is adjustable via the wrench menu.

A power output countdown can also be entered via the wrench menu. When this countdown reaches zero, the electricity meter switches off. The countdown can be queried using the `countdown` command.

[ta4_electricmeter|image]

### TA4 Laser

The TA4 laser is used for wireless power transmission. Two blocks are required for this: TA4 Laser Beam Emitter and TA4 Laser Beam Receiver. There must be an air gap between the two blocks so that the laser beam can be built up from the emitter to the receiver. First the emitter must be placed. This immediately switches on the laser beam and shows possible positions of the receiver. Possible positions for the receiver are also output via a chat message.

With the laser, distances of up to 96 blocks can be bridged. Once the connection has been established (no current has to flow), this is indicated via the info text of the emitter and also of the receiver.

The laser blocks themselves do not require any electricity.

[ta4_laser|image]



## Hydrogen

Electrolysis can be used to split electricity into hydrogen and oxygen. On the other hand, hydrogen can be converted back into electricity with oxygen from the air using a fuel cell.
This enables current peaks or an excess supply of electricity to be converted into hydrogen and thus stored.

In the game, electricity can be converted back into electricity via the fuel cell using the electrolyzer in hydrogen and hydrogen.
This means that electricity (in the form of hydrogen) can not only be stored in tanks, but also transported by means of the tank cart.

However, the conversion of electricity into hydrogen and back is lossy. Out of 100 units of electricity, only 95 units of electricity come out after the conversion to hydrogen and back.

[ta4_hydrogen|image]


### Electrolyzer

The electrolyzer converts electricity into hydrogen.
It must be powered from the left. On the right, hydrogen can be extracted via pipes and pumps.

The electrolyzer can draw up to 35 ku of electricity and then generates a hydrogen item every 4 s.
200 units of hydrogen fit into the electrolyzer.

The electrolyzer has a wrench menu for setting the current consumption and the switch-off point.

If the power stored in the power grid falls below the specified value of the switch-off point, the electrolyzer switches off automatically. This prevents the storage systems from running empty.

[ta4_electrolyzer|image]


### Fuel Cell

The fuel cell converts hydrogen into electricity.
It must be supplied with hydrogen from the left by a pump. The power connection is on the right.

The fuel cell can deliver up to 34 ku of electricity and needs a hydrogen item every 4 s.

Usually the fuel cell works as a category 2 generator (like other storage systems).
In this case, no other category 2 blocks such as the battery block can be charged. However, the fuel cell can also be used as a category 1 generator via the check box.

[ta4_fuelcell|image]


## Chemical Reactor

The reactor is used to process the ingredients obtained from the distillation tower or from other recipes into new products.
The plan on the left shows only one possible variant, since the arrangement of the silos and tanks depends on the recipe.

The primary output product is always output to the side of the reactor stand, regardless of whether it is a powder or a liquid. The (secondary) waste product is always discharged at the bottom of the reactor stand.

A reactor consists of:
- Various tanks and silos with the ingredients that are connected to the doser via pipes
- optionally a reactor base, which discharges the waste from the reactor (only necessary for recipes with two output products)
- the reactor stand, which must be placed on the base (if available). The stand has a power connection and draws 8 ku during operation.
- The reactor vessel that has to be placed on the reactor stand
- The filler pipe that must be placed on the reactor vessel
- The dosing device, which has to be connected to the tanks or silos and the filler pipe via pipes

Note 1: Liquids are only stored in tanks, solids and substances in powder form only in silos. This applies to ingredients and output products.

Note 2: Tanks or silos with different contents must not be connected to a pipe system. In contrast, several tanks or silos with the same content may hang in parallel on one line.

Cracking breaks long chains of hydrocarbons into short chains using a catalyst.
Gibbsite powder serves as a catalyst (is not consumed). It can be used to convert bitumen into fueloil, fueloil into naphtha and naphtha into gasoline.

In hydrogenation, pairs of hydrogen atoms are added to a molecule to convert short-chain hydrocarbons into long ones.
Here iron powder is required as a catalyst (is not consumed). It can be used to convert gas (propane) into isobutane,
isobutane into gasoline, gasoline into naphtha, naphtha into fueloil, and fueloil into bitumen.


[ta4_reactor|plan]


### TA4 Doser

Part of the chemical reactor.
Pipes for input materials can be connected on all 4 sides of the doser. The materials for the reactor are discharged upwards.

The recipe can be set and the reactor started via the doser.

As with other machines:
- if the doser is in standby mode, one or more ingredients are missing
- if the doser is in the blocked state, the output tank or silo is full, defective or incorrectly connected

The doser does not need any electricity. A recipe is processed every 10 s.

[ta4_doser|image]

### TA4 Reactor

Part of the chemical reactor. The reactor has a inventory for the catalyst items (for cracking and hydrogenation recipes).

[ta4_reactor|image]


### TA4 Filler Pipe

Part of the chemical reactor. Must be placed on the reactor. If this does not work, remove the pipe at the position above and place it again.

[ta4_fillerpipe|image]


### TA4 Reactor Stand

Part of the chemical reactor. Here is also the power connection for the reactor. The reactor requires 8 ku of electricity.

The stand has two pipe connections, to the right for the starting product and down for the waste, such as red mud in aluminum production.

[ta4_reactorstand|image]


### TA4 Reactor Base

Part of the chemical reactor. Is required for the drainage of the waste product.

[ta4_reactorbase|image]


### TA4 Silo

Part of the chemical reactor. Is required to store substances in powder or granule form.

[ta4_silo|image]




## ICTA Controller

The ICTA controller (ICTA stands for "If Condition Then Action") is used to monitor and control machines. The controller can be used to read in data from machines and other blocks and, depending on this, switch other machines and blocks on / off.

Machine data is read in and blocks and machines are controlled using commands. Chapter TA3 -> Logic / switching blocks is important for understanding how commands work.

The controller requires a battery to operate. The display is used to output data, the signal tower to display errors.

[ta4_icta_controller|image]



### TA4 ICTA controller

The controller works on the basis of `IF <condition> THEN <action>` rules. Up to 8 rules can be created per controller.

Examples of rules are:

- If a distributor is `blocked`, the pusher in front of it should be switched off
- If a machine shows an error, this should be shown on the display

The controller checks these rules cyclically. To do this, a cycle time in seconds (`` Cycle / s '') must be specified for each rule (1..1000).

For rules that evaluate an on / off input, e.g. from a switch or detector, cycle time 0 must be specified. The value 0 means that this rule should always be carried out when the input signal has changed, e.g. the button has sent a new value.

All rules should only be executed as often as necessary. This has two advantages:

- the battery of the controller lasts longer (each controller needs a battery)
- the load for the server is lower (therefore fewer lags)

You have to set a delay time (`after/s`) for each action. If the action is to be carried out immediately, 0 must be entered.

The controller has its own help and information on all commands via the controller menu.

[ta4_icta_controller|image]

### Battery

The battery must be placed in close proximity to the controller, i.e. in one of the 26 positions around the controller.

[ta4_battery|image]

### TA4 Signal Tower

The signal tower can display red, green and orange. A combination of the 3 colors is not possible.

[ta4_signaltower|image]



## TA4 Lua Controller

As the name suggests, the Lua controller must be programmed in the Lua programming language. The manual in English is here available:

https://github.com/joe7575/techage/blob/master/manuals/ta4_lua_controller_EN.md

The Lua controller also requires a battery. The battery must be placed in close proximity to the controller, i.e. in one of the 26 positions around the controller.

[ta4_lua_controller|image]

### TA4 Lua Server

The server is used for the central storage of data from several Lua controllers. It also saves the data after a server restart.

[ta4_lua_server|image]

### TA4 Sensor Box / Chest

The TA4 sensor box is used to set up automatic warehouses or vending machines in conjunction with the Lua controller.
If something is put into the box or removed, or one of the "F1" / "F2" keys is pressed, an event signal is sent to the Lua controller.
The sensor box supports the following commands:

- The status of the box can be queried via `state = $send_cmnd(<num>, "state")`. Possible answers are: "empty", "loaded", "full"
- The last player action can be queried via `name, action = $send_cmnd(<num>, "action")`. `name` is the player name. One of the following is returned as `action`: "put", "take", "f1", "f2".
- The contents of the box can be read out via `stacks = $send_cmnd(<num>, "stacks")`. See: https://github.com/joe7575/techage/blob/master/manuals/ta4_lua_controller_EN.md#sensor-chest
- Via `$send_cmnd(<num>, "text", "press both buttons and\nput something into the chest")` the text can be set in the menu of the sensor box.

The checkbox "Allow public chest access" can be used to set whether the box can be used by everyone or only by players who have access/protection rights here.

[ta4_sensor_chest|image]

### TA4 Lua Controller Terminal

The terminal is used for input / output for the Lua controller.

[ta4_terminal|image]

## TA4 Displays

Techage offers various displays that can be used to display text. The displays can be accessed via the Lua controller,
but also via the ICTA controller, or via the TA3 terminal.

- TA4 Display / TA4 Display XL: Display of 5 lines of text in proportional font. The flexible character width means that different numbers of characters can be displayed per line.
- TA4 Display II / TA4 Display II XXL: Display of up to 20 lines of text in fixed-width fonts. The maximum number of characters that can be displayed per line is defined here.

All displays show a number after they have been placed. The displays can be accessed via this number. All displays have the same commands for this.

The commands for controlling in BASIC mode:

```BASIC
10 DCLR(num)              ' Clear the screen with the number 'num'.
20 DPUTS(num, row, text)  ' Text output to the screen in line 'row' (1..n).
                          ' The value 0 for 'row' means that the text is
                          ' appended after the last line.
```

The commands for controlling by means of the Lua controller:

```lua
$clear_screen(num)        -- Clear the screen with the number 'num'.
$display(num, row, text)  -- Text output to the screen in line 'row' (1..n).
                          -- The value 0 for 'row' means that the text is
                          -- appended after the last line.
```

[ta4_display2|image]

### TA4 Display

Text can be displayed on the display, and the display can show 5 lines.

Text lines are always displayed left-aligned. If the text is to be centered horizontally, the text must be preceded by the character "\t" (tab).

The display is updated at most once per second.

[ta4_display|image]

### TA4 Display XL

TThe TA4 Display XL is twice the size of the TA4 Display.

Text lines are always left-aligned. If the text is to be centered horizontally, the text must be preceded by the character “\t” (tab).

The display is updated every two seconds at most.

[ta4_displayXL|image]

### TA4 Display II

The display can be flexibly configured. The number of lines and characters per line,
as well as the text and background color can be set using the wrench menu:

- The screen resolution can be set in the range from 16x8 to 40x20 characters x lines.
- The text color can be set as a color code in the range from 0 to 63.
- The background color can also be set as a color code in the range from 0 to 63.

The chat command `/ta_color64' shows the color palette with the color codes.

The update rate of the display is directly dependent on the resolution and is one second at 16x8 and around 6 seconds at 40x20.

[ta4_display2|image]

### TA4 Display II XXL

The same settings apply to the XXL display as to the Display II. However, the XXL display is 9 times the size of the Display II
and therefore consists of a central "TA4 Display II XXL inside" block and a further 8 "TA4 Display II XXL outside" blocks, which
must be placed around the central block accordingly.

[ta4_displayXXL|image]

## TA4 Logic/Switching Modules

### TA4 Button/Switch

Only the appearance of the TA4 button/switch has changed. The functionality is the same as with the TA3 button/switch. With the wrench menu, however, the data can be changed later.

[ta4_button|image]

### TA4 2x Button

This block has two buttons that can be individually configured using the wrench menu. The labeling and the target block address can be configured for each button. In addition, the command that is to be sent can be configured for each button.

[ta4_button_2x|image]


### TA4 4x Button

This block has four buttons that can be individually configured using the wrench menu. The labeling and the target block address can be configured for each button. In addition, the command that is to be sent can be configured for each button.

[ta4_button_4x|image]

### TA4 2x Signal Lamp

This block has two lamps that can be controlled individually. Each lamp can display the colors "red", "green" and "amber". The labeling for both lamps can be configured via the wrench menu. The lamps can be controlled using the following commands:

- Switch lamp 1 to red: `$send_cmnd(1234, "red", 1)`
- Switch lamp 2 to green: `$send_cmnd(1234, "green ", 2)`
- Switch lamp 1 to orange: `$send_cmnd(1234, "amber", 1)`
- Switch lamp 2 off: `$send_cmnd(1234, "off", 2)`

[ta4_signallamp_2x|image]

### TA4 4x Signal Lamp

This block has four lamps that can be controlled individually. Each lamp can display the colors "red", "green" and "amber". The labeling for all lamps can be configured via the wrench menu. The lamps can be controlled using the following commands:

- Switch lamp 1 to red: `$send_cmnd(1234, "red", 1)`
- Switch lamp 2 to green: `$send_cmnd(1234, "green ", 2)`
- Switch lamp 3 to orange: `$send_cmnd(1234, "amber", 3)`
- Switch lamp 4 off: `$send_cmnd(1234, "off", 4)`

[ta4_signallamp_4x|image]

### TA4 Player Detector

Only the appearance of the TA4 player detector has changed. The functionality is the same as with the TA3 player detector.

[ta4_playerdetector|image]

### TA4 State Collector

[ta4_collector|image]

The status collector queries all configured machines in turn for the status. If one of the machines has reached or exceeded a preconfigured status, an "on" command is sent. For example, many machines can be easily monitored for faults from a Lua controller.

### TA4 Item Detector

The functionality is the same as for the TA3 item detector. In addition, the detector counts the items passed on.
This counter can be queried with the 'count' command and reset with 'reset'.

[ta4_detector|image]

### TA4 Node Detector

The functionality is the same as with the TA3 Node Detector.

In contrast to the TA3 node detector, the positions to be monitored can be configured individually here. To do this, the "Record" button must be pressed. Then all blocks must be clicked, the position of which is to be checked. Then the "Done" button must be pressed.

Up to 4 blocks can be selected.

[ta4_nodedetector|image]

### TA4 Energy Storage Charge Detector

The charge detector measures the state of charge of the power grid's energy storage every 8 s.

If the value falls below a configurable threshold (switching point), a command (default: "off") is sent. If the value rises above this switching point again, a second command (default: "on") is sent. This allows consumers to be disconnected from the grid when the charge level of the energy storage device falls below the specified switching point.

To do this, the charge detector must be connected to the grid via a junction box. The charge detector is configured via the open-end wrench menu.

[ta4_chargedetector|image]

### TA4 Gaze Sensor

The TA4 gaze sensor generates a command when the block is viewed/focused by the owner or other configured players and sends a second command when the block is no longer focused. It thus serves as a replacement for buttons/switches, for example to open/close doors.

The TA4 Gaze Sensor can only be programmed using the open-end wrench menu. If you have an open-end wrench in your hand, the sensor does not trigger, even if it is focused.

[ta4_gaze_sensor|image]

### TA4 Sequencer

Entire processes can be programmed using the TA4 sequencer. Here's an example:

```
-- this is a comment
[1] send 188 reset
[50] send 188 moveto 771,19,-280
[100] goto 1
```

- Each line begins with a number which corresponds to a point in time `[<num>]`
- Values from 1 to 50000 are permitted for times
- 1 corresponds to 100 ms, 50000 corresponds to about 4 game days
- Empty lines or comments are allowed (`-- comment`)
- With `send <num> <command> <data>` you can send a command to a block
- With `goto <num>` you can jump to another line / point in time
- With `stop` you can stop the sequencer with a delay so that it does not receive a new command
  accepts from a button or other block (to complete a movement)
  Without `stop`, the sequencer goes into stopped mode immediately after the last command.

The TA4 sequencer supports the following techage commands:

- `goto <num>` Jump to a command line and start the sequencer
- `stop` Stop the sequencer
- `on` and `off` as aliases for `goto 1` resp. `stop`

The `goto` command is only accepted when the sequencer is stopped.

The cycle time (default: 100 ms) can be changed for the sequencer via the open-end wrench menu.

[ta4_sequencer|image]



## Move/Turn Controller

### TA4 Move Controller (deprecated)

The TA4 Move Controller is similar to "Door Controller 2", but the selected blocks are not removed, but can be moved.
Since the moving blocks can take players and mobs standing on the block with them, elevators and similar transport systems can be built with them.

Instructions:

- Set the controller and train the blocks to be moved via the menu (up to 16 blocks can be trained)
- the "flight route" must be entered via an x, y, z specification (relative) (the maximum distance is 1000 m)
- The movement can be tested with the menu buttons "Move A-B" and "Move B-A"
- you can also fly through walls or other blocks
- The target position for the blocks can also be occupied. In this case, the blocks are saved "invisibly". This is intended for sliding doors and the like

The Move Controller supports the following techage commands:

- `a2b` Move block from A to B.
- `b2a` Move block from B to A.
- `move` Move block to the other side

You can switch to the `move xyz` operating mode via the wrench menu. After switching, the following techage commands are supported:

- `move2` With this command, the flight route must also be specified as an x,y,z vector.
  Example Lua Controller: `$send_cmnd(MOVE_CTLR, "move2", "0,12,0")`
- `moveto` Move block to the given destination position (the destination position is valid for the first marked block, the other blocks are moved relative to this position)
- `reset` move block(s) back to start position

**Important instructions:**

- If several blocks are to be moved, the block that is to take the players/mobs must be clicked first when training.
- If the `moveto` command is used, the specified target position applies to the block that is clicked first during training.
- If the block that is supposed to take the players/mobs has a reduced height, the height must be set in the controller using the open-ended wrench menu (e.g. height = 0.5). Otherwise the player/mob will not be "found" and will not be taken away.

[ta4_movecontroller|image]

### TA4 Move Controller II

The TA4 Move Controller II is a further development of the TA4 Move Controller. It can move up to 16 blocks and only supports the `moveto` and `reset` commands.
It also has an inventory where blocks are stored if they cannot be placed because the position is already occupied.

In the event of a server crash or restart, the blocks can be restored from the inventory if necessary.

Instructions:

- Place the controller and train the blocks to be moved via the menu (press the "Record" button). (Up to 16 blocks can be trained.)
- Test the movement using the "Test move" and "Reset" menu buttons.
- You can also fly through walls or other blocks.
- The target position for the blocks can be occupied. In this case, the blocks are saved in the blocks inventory. This is intended for sliding doors and similar devices.

The Move Controller II supports the following techage commands:

- `moveto` moves a block to the specified target position (the target position refers to the first selected block; the remaining blocks are moved relative to this position).
- `reset` moves the block(s) back to the starting position.

Example Lua Controller: `$send_cmnd(MOVE_CTLR, "moveto", "1234,12,-567")`

**Important Notes:**

- If multiple blocks are to be moved, the specified target position refers to the block that was clicked first during training.
  The other blocks are moved relative to this position.
- If the block that is to carry the players/mobs has a reduced height, the height must be set in the controller via the wrench menu (e.g., height = 0.5).
  Otherwise, the player/mob will not be "found" and therefore not carried.

[ta4_movecontroller2|image]

### TA4 Turn Controller

The TA4 turn controller is similar to the "Move Controller", but the selected blocks are not moved, but rotated around their center to the right or left.

Instructions:

- Set the controller and train the blocks to be moved via the menu (up to 16 blocks can be trained)
- The movement can be tested with the menu buttons "Turn left" and "Turn right"

The turn controller supports the following techage commands:

- `left` Turn left
- `right` Turn right
- `uturn` Turn 180 degrees

## TA4 Lamps

TA4 contains a series of powerful lamps that enable better illumination or take on special tasks.

### TA4 LED Grow Light

The TA4 LED grow light enables fast and vigorous growth of all plants from the `farming` mod. The lamp illuminates a 3x3 field, so that plants can also be grown underground.
The lamp must be placed one block above the ground in the middle of the 3x3 field.

The lamp can also be used to grow flowers. If the lamp is placed over a 3x3 flower bed made of "Garden Soil" (Mod `compost`), the flowers grow there automatically (above and below ground).

You can harvest the flowers with the Signs Bot, which also has a corresponding sign that must be placed in front of the flower field.

The lamp requires 1 ku of electricity.

[ta4_growlight|image]

### TA4 Street Lamp

The TA4 LED street lamp is a lamp with particularly strong illumination. The lamp consists of the lamp housing, lamp arm and lamp pole blocks.

The current must be led from below through the mast up to the lamp housing. First pull the power line up and then "plaster" the power cable with lamp pole blocks.

The lamp requires 1 ku of electricity.

[ta4_streetlamp|image]

### TA4 LED Industrial Lamp

The TA4 LED industrial lamp is a lamp with particularly strong illumination. The lamp must be powered from above.

The lamp requires 1 ku of electricity.

[ta4_industriallamp|image]

### TA4 traffic light

The TA4 traffic light is available in two versions: black (European version) and yellow (American version). In addition, there is a mast, an arm and a connector block. The traffic light can be mounted on or to a mast. However, it cannot be mounted to an arm. This is for technical reasons. This is why there is the connector block, which is placed between the arm and the traffic light.

The traffic light can be controlled using commands like the TA4 signal tower. If the TA4 player detector is also used, the traffic light can also react to pedestrians or vehicles.

The traffic light does not require any electricity.

[ta4_trafficlight|image]


## TA4 Liquid Filter

The liquid filter filters red mud.
A part of the red mud becomes lye, which can be collected at the bottom in a tank.
The other part becomes desert cobblestone and clutters the filter material.
If the filter is too clogged, it has to be cleaned and re-filled.
The filter consists of a base layer, 7 identical filter layers and a filling layer at the top.

[ta4_liquid_filter|image]

### Base Layer

You can see the structure of this layer in the plan.

The lye is collected in the tank.

[ta4_liquid_filter_base|plan]

### Gravel Layer

This layer has to be filled with gravel as shown in the plan.
In total, there must be seven layers of gravel.
The filter will become cluttered over time, so that it has to be cleaned and re-filled.

[ta4_liquid_filter_gravel|plan]

### Filling Layer

This layer is used to fill the filter with red mud.
The red mud must be pumped into the filler pipe.

[ta4_liquid_filter_top|plan]




## TA4 Collider (Particle Accelerator)

The Collider is a research facility that conducts basic research. Experience points can be collected here, which are required for TA5 (Future Age).

Like its original at CERN in Geneva, the collider must be built underground. The standard setting here is Y <= -28. The value can, however, be changed by the server personnel via configuration. Please ask or try the "TA4 Collider Detector Worker" block.

Only one collider can be operated per player. So it makes no sense to set up two or more colliders. Experience points are credited to the player who owns the collider. The experience points cannot be transferred.

A collider consists of a "ring" made of tubes and magnets as well as a detector with a cooling system.

- The detector is the heart of the system. This is where the scientific experiments take place. The detector is 3x3x7 blocks in size.
- 22 TA4 Collider Magnets (not the TA4 Collider Detector Magnets!) must be connected to each other via 5 blocks of the TA4 vacuum tube. Each magnet also requires electricity and a gas connection for cooling. The whole thing forms (as shown in the plan on the right) a square with an edge length of 37 meters.

The plan shows the facility from above:

- the gray block is the detector with the worker block in the middle
- the red blocks are the magnets, the blue the vacuum tubes

[techage_collider_plan|plan]

### Detector

The detector is set up automatically with the help of the "TA4 Collider Detector Worker" block (similar to the derrick). All of the materials required for this must first be placed in the worker block. The detector is shown symbolically on the worker block. The detector is set up across the worker block.

The detector can also be dismantled again with the help of the worker block.

The connections for electricity, gas and vacuum tubes are located on the two front sides of the detector. A TA4 pump must be connected at the top in order to suck the tube empty / to create the vacuum.

The cooling system must be connected to the rear of the detector. The cooling system is shown in the plan on the right. In addition to the TA4 heat exchanger of the energy storage unit (which is used here for cooling), a TA4 cooler block is also required.

Note: The arrow on the heat exchanger must point away from the detector. The heat exchanger must also be supplied with electricity.

[ta4_cooler|plan]


- In addition, cooling is required, which must also be installed at the detector. Isobutane is required for cooling.
- The system requires quite a bit of electricity. Therefore, it makes sense to have your own power supply.

### Control / TA4 Terminal

The collider is controlled via a TA4 terminal (not via the TA4 Lua controller terminal).

This terminal must be connected to the detector. The number of the detector is displayed as info text on the worker block.

The terminal supports the following commands:

- `connect <number>` (connect to the detector)
- `start` (starting the detector)
- `stop` (stop the detector)
- `test <number>` (checking a magnet)
- `points` (query of the experience points already achieved)

If an error occurs on a magnet during the `start`, the number of the magnet is output. The `test` command can be used to request further information on the magnet error.

[ta4_terminal|image]

### Cooling and power

Each TA4 Collider magnet must also be supplied with electricity (as shown on the right in the plan) and with Isobutane for cooling:

- The connection for the power is on the top of the magnet.
- The connection for the cooling is on the front of the magnet.
- A TA4 pump and a TA4 tank with at least 250 units of isobutane are also required to cool the entire system.
- The system also requires a lot of electricity. It therefore makes sense to have your own power supply with at least 145 ku.

[techage_collider_plan2|plan]

### Construction

The following sequence is recommended when setting up the collider:

- Put a forceload block. Only the detector with the cooling system has to be in the area of ​​the forceload block.
- Set the worker block, fill it with items and set up the detector via the menu
- Build the ring with tubes and magnets
- Connect all magnets and the detector with power cables
- Connect all magnets and the detector with the yellow tubes and pump the isobutane into the tube system with a pump
- Install a TA4 pump as a vacuum pump on the detector and switch it on (no additional tank is required). If the pump goes into "standby", the vacuum is established. This will take a few seconds
- assemble the cooler (heat exchanger) and connect it to the power cable
- Place the TA4 terminal in front of the detector and connect it to the detector via `connect <number>`
- Switch on / connect the power supply
- switch on the cooler (heat exchanger)
- Switch on the detector via `start` on the TA4 terminal. After a few test steps, the detector goes into normal operation or outputs an error.
- The collider has to run continuously and then gradually delivers experience points. For 10 points, the collider has to run for a few hours

[techage_ta4c|image]




## More TA4 Blocks

### TA4 Recipe Block

Up to 10 recipes can be saved in the recipe block. These recipes can then be called up via a TA4 Autocrafter command. This enables the autocrafter's recipe to be configured using a command. The recipes in the recipe block can also be queried directly using a command.

`input <index>` reads a recipe from the TA4 recipe block. `<index>` is the number of the recipe. The block returns a list of recipe ingredients.

Example: `$send_cmnd(1234, "input", 1)`

[ta4_recipeblock|image]

### TA4 Autocrafter

The function corresponds to that of TA3.

The processing power is 4 items every 4 s. The autocrafter requires 9 ku of electricity for this.

In addition, the TA4 Autocrafter supports the selection of different recipes using the following commands:

`recipe "<number>.<index>"` switches the autocrafter to a recipe from the TA4 Recipe Block. `<number>` is the number of the recipe block, `<index>` the recipe number. Example: `$send_cmnd(1234, "recipe", "5467.1")`

Alternatively, a recipe can also be selected via the list of ingredients, such as:
`$send_cmnd(1234, "recipe", "default:coal_lump,,,default:stick")`
All technical names of a recipe must be specified here, separated by commas. See also the command `input` in the TA4 recipe block.

The `flush` command moves all items from the input inventory to the output inventory. The command returns `true` if the input inventory was completely emptied. If `false` was returned (output inventory full), the command must be repeated at a later time.

[ta4_autocrafter|image]

### TA4 Tank

See TA3 tank.

A TA4 tank can hold 2000 units or 200 barrels of liquid.

[ta4_tank|image]

### TA4 Pump

See TA3 pump.

The TA4 pump pumps 8 units of liquid every two seconds.

In the "Flow limiter" mode, the number of units pumped by the pump can be limited. The flow limiter mode can be activated via the open-end wrench menu by configuring the number of units in the menu. Once the configured number of units have been pumped, the pump will turn off. When the pump is turned on again, it will pump the configured number of units again and then turn off.

The flow limiter can also be configured and started using a Lua or Beduino controller.

The pump also supports the `flowrate` command. This allows the total flow rate through the pump to be queried.

[ta4_pump|image]

### TA4 Furnace Heater

With TA4, the industrial furnace also has its electrical heating. The oil burner and the blower can be replaced with the heater.

The heater requires 14 ku of electricity.

[ta4_furnaceheater|image]

### TA4 Water Pump (deprecated)

This block can no longer be crafted and will be replaced by the TA4 water inlet block.

### TA4 Water Inlet

Some recipes require water. The water must be pumped from the sea with a pump (water at y = 1). A "pool" made up of a few water blocks is not sufficient for this!

To do this, the water inlet block must be placed in the water and connected to the pump via pipes. If the block is placed in the water, it must be ensured that there is water under the block (water must be at least 2 blocks deep).

[ta4_waterinlet|image]

### TA4 Tube

TA4 also has its own tubes in the TA4 design. These can be used like standard tubes.
But: TA4 pushers and TA4 distributors only achieve their full performance when used with TA4 tubes.

[ta4_tube|image]

### TA4 Pusher

The function basically corresponds to that of TA2 / TA3. In addition, a menu can be used to configure which objects should be taken from a TA4 chest and transported further.
The processing power is 12 items every 2 s, if TA4 tubes are used on both sides. Otherwise there are only 6 items every 2 s.

In the "flow limiter" mode, the number of items that are moved by the pusher can be limited. The flow limiter mode can be activated via the open-end wrench menu by configuring the number of items in the menu. As soon as the configured number of items have been moved, the pusher switches off. If the pusher is switched on again, it moves the configured number of items again and then switches off.

The TA4 pusher can also be configured and started using a Lua or Beduino controller.

Here are the additional commands for the Lua controller:

- `config` is used to configure the pusher, analogous to manual configuration via the menu.
   Example: `$send_cmnd(1234, "config", "default:dirt")`
   With `$send_cmnd(1234, "config", "")` the configuration is deleted
- `limit` is used to set the number of items for the flow limiter mode:
   Example: `$send_cmnd(1234, "limit", 7)`

[ta4_pusher|image]

### TA4 Chest

The function corresponds to that of TA3. The chest can hold more content.

In addition, the TA4 chest has a shadow inventory for configuration. Here certain stack locations can be pre-assigned with an item. Pre-assigned inventory stacks are only filled with these items when filling. A TA4 pusher or TA4 injector with the appropriate configuration is required to empty a pre-assigned inventory stacks.

[ta4_chest|image]

### TA4 8x2000 Chest

The TA4 8x2000 chest does not have a normal inventory like other chest, but has 8 stores, whereby each store can hold up to 2000 items of one sort. The orange buttons can be used to move items to or from the store. The box can also be filled or emptied with a pusher (TA2, TA3 or TA4) as usual.

If the chest is filled with a pusher, all stores fill from left to right. If all 8 stores are full and no further items can be added, further items are rejected.

**Row function**

Several TA4 8x2000 chests can be connected to a large chest with more content. To do this, the chests must be placed in a row one after the other.

First the front chest must be placed, then the stacking chests are placed behind with the same direction of view (all boxes have the front towards the player). With 2 chests in a row, the size increases to 8x4000, etc.

The rows of chests can no longer be removed. There are two ways to dismantle the chests:

- Empty and remove the front chest. This unlocks the next chest and can be removed.
- Empty the front chest so far that all stores contain a maximum of 2000 items. This unlocks the next chest and can be removed.

The chests have an "order" checkbox. If this checkbox is activated, the stores are no longer completely emptied by a pusher. The last item remains in the store as a default. This results in a fixed assignment of items to storage locations.

The chest can only be used by players who can build at this location, i.e. who have protection rights. It does not matter who sets the chest.

The chest has an additional command for the Lua controller:

- `count` is used to request how many items are in the chest.
  Example 1: `$send_cmnd(CHEST, "count")` -> Sum of items across all 8 stores
  Example 2: `$send_cmnd(CHEST, "count", 2)` -> number of items in store 2 (second from left)
- `storesize` is used to read the size of one of the eight stores:
  Example: `$send_cmnd(CHEST, "storesize")` -> function returns e.g. 6000

[ta4_8x2000_chest|image]



### TA4 Distributor

The function corresponds to that of TA2.
The processing power is 24 items every 4 s, provided TA4 tubes are used on all sides. Otherwise there are only 12 items every 4 s.

[ta4_distributor|image]

### TA4 High Performance Distributor

The function corresponds to that of the normal TA4 distributor, with two differences:
The processing power is 36 items every 4 s, provided TA4 tubes are used on all sides. Otherwise there are only 18 items every 4 s.
Furthermore, up to 8 items can be configured per direction.

[ta4_high_performance_distributor|image]

### TA4 Gravel Sieve

The function corresponds to that of TA2.
The processing power is 4 items every 4 s. The block requires 5 ku of electricity.

[ta4_gravelsieve|image]

### TA4 Grinder

The function corresponds to that of TA2.
The processing power is 4 items every 4 s. The block requires 9 ku of electricity.

[ta4_grinder|image]

### TA4 Quarry

The function largely corresponds to that of TA2.

In addition, the hole size can be set between 3x3 and 11x11 blocks.
The maximum depth is 80 meters. The quarry requires 14 ku of electricity.

[ta4_quarry|image]

### TA4 Water Remover

The Water Remover removes water from an area of up to 21 x 21 x 80 m. The main
purpose is to drain caves. But it can also be used to "drill" a hole into the sea.

The Water Remover needs electricity and a pipe connection to a liquid tank. The
Water Remover is placed at the highest point of the cave and removes the water
from the cave to the lowest point. The Water Remover digs one water block every
two seconds. The device requires 10 ku of electricity.

Technically, the Water Remover replaces the water blocks with a special air block
that is not visible and not walkable but prevents the water from flowing back.

[ta4_waterremover|image]

### TA4 Electronic Fab

The function corresponds to that of TA2, only different chips are produced here.
The processing power is one chip every 6 s. The block requires 12 ku of electricity for this.

[ta4_electronicfab|image]

### TA4 Injector

The function corresponds to that of TA3.

The processing power is up to 8 times four items every 4 seconds.

[ta4_injector|image]

### TA4 Recycler

The recycler is a machine that processes all Techage recipes backwards, i.e. it can dismantle machines and blocks back into their components.

The machine can disassemble pretty much any Techage and Hyperloop blocks. But not all recipe items/materials can be recycled:

- Wood turns into sticks
- Stone turns into sand or gravel
- Semiconductors / chips cannot be recycled
- Tools cannot be recycled

The processing power is one item every 8 s.  The block requires 16 ku of electricity for this.

[ta4_recycler|image]
