# Tech Age [techage] (Minetest 5.4+)

Tech Age, a mod to go through 5 tech ages in search of wealth and power.

![screenshot](https://github.com/joe7575/techage/blob/master/screenshot.png)


Important facts:
- techage is not backwards compatible and cannot be installed on a server together with TechPack
- techage is significantly more extensive, since additional mods are integrated
- techage represents 5 technological ages:
  - Iron Age (TA1) - simple tools like coal pile, coal burner, gravel sieve, hammer for getting ores and making goods
  - Steam Age (TA2) - Simple machines that are powered by steam engines and drive axles
  - Oil Age (TA3) - More modern machines that are powered by electricity.  
  - Present (TA4) - Electricity from renewable energy sources such as sun and wind.
  - Future (TA5) - Machines to overcome space and time, new sources of energy and other achievements.
- Since the levels build on each other, all ages have to be run through one after the other

In contrast to TechPack, the resources are more limited and it is much more difficult to pass all levels.
(no endless ore generation by means of cobble generators)

**Techage blocks store information outside of the block. This is for performance reasons.
If you move, place, or remove blocks with any tool, at best, only the information is lost.
In the worst case, the server crashes.**

### Dependencies  
Required: default, doors, bucket, stairs, screwdriver, basic_materials, tubelib2, networks, minecart, lcdlib, safer_lua, doclib, fakelib  
Recommended: signs_bot, hyperloop, compost, techpack_stairway, autobahn  
Optional: unified_inventory, wielded_light, unifieddyes, lua-mashal, lsqlite3, moreores, ethereal, mesecon


The mods `default`, `doors`, `bucket`, `stairs`, and `screwdriver` are part of Minetest Game.

`basic_materials` and `fakelib` can be found on ContentDB: https://content.minetest.net/

The following mods in the newest version have to be downloaded directly from GitHub:
* [tubelib2](https://github.com/joe7575/tubelib2)
* [networks](https://github.com/joe7575/networks)
* [minecart](https://github.com/joe7575/minecart)
* [lcdlib](https://github.com/joe7575/lcdlib)
* [safer_lua](https://github.com/joe7575/safer_lua)
* [doclib](https://github.com/joe7575/doclib)

It is highly recommended that you install the following mods, too:

* [signs_bot](https://github.com/joe7575/signs_bot): For many automation tasks in TA3/TA4 like farming, mining, and item transportation
* [hyperloop](https://github.com/joe7575/Minetest-Hyperloop): Used as passenger transportation system in TA4
* [compost](https://github.com/joe7575/compost): The garden soil is needed for the TA4 LED Grow Light based flower bed
* [techpack_stairway](https://github.com/joe7575/techpack_stairway): Ladders, stairways, and bridges for your machines
* [autobahn](https://github.com/joe7575/autobahn): Street blocks and slopes with stripes for faster traveling
* [ta4_jetpack](https://github.com/joe7575/ta4_jetpack): A Jetpack with hydrogen as fuel and TA4 recipe

More recommended Techage related mods by other authors:

* [ta4_addons](https://github.com/Thomas--S/ta4_addons) from Thomas--S: A Touchscreen for the Lua controller
* [ts_vehicles](https://github.com/Thomas--S/ts_vehicles) from Thomas--S: A mod to provide cars and other vehicles for Minetest.
* [ta_apiary](https://gitlab.com/lesya_minetest_mods/ta_apiary) from Olesya Sibidanova: TechAge Machines for beekeeping

For large servers with many players, the following packages are recommended:

* lua-mashal for faster serialization/deserialization of data
* lsqlite3 for storing node and network data

The packages have to be installed via [luarocks](https://luarocks.org/):

    luarocks --lua-version 5.1 install lsqlite3
    luarocks --lua-version 5.1 install lua-marshal

To enable these `unsafe` packages, add 'techage' and 'lua-marshal'
to the list of trusted mods in `minetest.conf`:

    secure.trusted_mods = techage,lua-marshal

and add the following line to your `world.mt` or `minetest.conf`:

    techage_use_sqlite = true

Available worlds will be converted to 'lsqlite3', but there is no way back, so:

**Never disable 'lsqlite3' for a world that has already been used!**
