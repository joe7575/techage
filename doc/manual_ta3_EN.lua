    "In TA3 (and TA4) the machines are powered by electricity. To do this\\, machines\\, storage systems\\, and generators must be connected with power cables.\n"..
    "TA3 has 2 types of power cables:\n"..
    "\n"..
    "  - Insulated cables (TA power cables) for local wiring in the floor or in buildings. These cables can be hidden in the wall or in the floor (can be \"plastered\" with the trowel).\n"..
    "  - Overland lines (TA power line) for outdoor cabling over long distances. These cables are protected and cannot be removed by other players.\n"..
    "\n"..
    "Several consumers\\, storage systems\\, and generators can be operated together in a power network. Networks can be set up with the help of the junction boxes.\n"..
    "If too little electricity is provided\\, consumers run out.\n"..
    "In this context\\, it is also important that the functionality of Forceload blocks is understood\\, because generators\\, for example\\, only supply electricity when the corresponding map block is loaded. This can be enforced with a forceload block.\n"..
    "\n"..
    "In TA4 there is also a cable for the solar system.\n"..
    "\n"..
    "\n"..
    "\n",
    "Storage systems in the power grid fulfill two tasks:\n"..
    "\n"..
    "  - To cope with peaks in demand: All generators always deliver just as much power as is needed. However\\, if consumers are switched on/off or there are fluctuations in demand for other reasons\\, consumers can fail for a short time. To prevent this\\, there should always be at least one battery block in every network. This serves as a buffer and compensates for these fluctuations in the seconds range.\n"..
    "  - To store regenerative energy: Solar and wind are not available 24 hours a day. So that the power supply does not fail when no electricity is produced\\, one or more storage systems must be installed in the network. Alternatively\\, the gaps can also be bridged with oil/coal electricity.\n"..
    "\n"..
    "A storage system indicates its capacity in kud\\, i.e. ku per day. For example\\, a storage system with 100 kud delivers 100 ku for one game day\\, or 10 ku for 10 game days.\n"..
    "\n"..
    "All TA3/TA4 energy sources have adjustable charging characteristics. By default this is set to \"80% - 100%\". This means that when the storage system is 80% full\\, the output is reduced further and further until it switches off completely at 100%. If electricity is required in the network\\, 100% will never be reached\\, since the power of the generator has at some point dropped to the electricity demand in the network and the storage system is no longer charged\\, but only the consumers are served.\n"..
    "\n"..
    "This has several advantages:\n"..
    "\n"..
    "  - The charging characteristics are adjustable. This means\\, for example\\, that oil/coal energy sources can be reduced at 60% and regenerative energy sources only at 80%. This means that oil/coal is only burned if there are not enough renewable energy sources available.\n"..
    "  - Several energy sources can be operated in parallel and are loaded almost evenly\\, because all energy sources work\\, for example\\, up to 80% of the storage system's charging capacity at their full capacity and then reduce their capacity at the same time.\n"..
    "  - All storage systems in a network form a large buffer. The charging capacity and the filling level of the entire storage system can always be read in percent on every storage system\\, but also on the electricity terminal.\n"..
    "\n"..
    " \n"..
    "\n",
    "For local wiring in the floor or in buildings.\n"..
    "Branches can be realized using junction boxes. The maximum cable length between machines or junction boxes is 1000 m. A maximum of 1000 nodes can be connected in a power network. All blocks with power connection\\, including junction boxes\\, count as nodes.\n"..
    "\n"..
    "Since the power cables are not automatically protected\\, the land lines (TA power line) are recommended for longer distances.\n"..
    "\n"..
    "Power cables can be plastered with the trowel so they can be hidden in the wall or in the floor. All stone\\, clay and other blocks without \"intelligence\" can be used as plastering material. Dirt does not work because dirt can be converted to grass or the like\\, which would destroy the line.\n"..
    "\n"..
    "For plastering\\, the cable must be clicked on with the trowel. The material with which the cable is to be plastered must be on the far left in the player inventory.\n"..
    "The cables can be made visible again by clicking on the block with the trowel.\n"..
